# @starwind-ui/vue

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Dropzone now tells you when it does not keep a dropped file. Before, if you dropped a PDF on a Dropzone with `accept="image/*"`, nothing happened and no event fired. Now Dropzone rejects dropped files that do not match `accept`. A Dropzone without `multiple` keeps one file and rejects the other dropped files.
  - To get the rejected files, listen for the `starwind:files-reject` event on the Dropzone. In React and Svelte, use `onFilesReject`. In Vue, use `@files-reject`. The event gives you the rejected `files` and the drop `event`.
  - When Dropzone keeps none of the dropped files, the styled Dropzone shows an error border and the root gets a `data-rejected` attribute. The error clears on the next accepted drop, file picker choice, `setFiles` call, or form reset. When a drop keeps some of the files, the event fires but the error border does not show.

  Screen readers do not announce a rejected drop. To tell screen reader users, show a message in a live region when the reject event fires.

### Patch Changes

- A Combobox with `required` now stops a plain HTML form from submitting when no option is selected. Before, the empty form submitted and no message showed. Now the browser shows its message and puts focus in the Combobox input. The list stays closed so it does not cover the message.

  A Combobox without `required` still lets the Enter key submit the form as before.

- Form now lets a submit button with `formnovalidate` skip validation. For example, a "Save draft" button with `formnovalidate` submits the form while required fields are still empty. Your `onSubmit` handler runs, and `submitter` is that button. If you do not use `onSubmit`, the browser submits the form. When a draft submit starts while a normal submit waits for an async check, only the draft submit runs, so `onSubmit` runs one time. Other submit buttons in the form still validate. A `novalidate` attribute on the form does not turn off Form validation.

  Errors that you show with `validate()` now go away when the user fixes the field. This works for `validate({ names, reveal: true })` and for errors that you show with `errorVisibility="manual"`. These fields now check again on the `revalidationTiming` schedule, the same as after a submit. This helps a multi-step form that checks one step when the user clicks "Next". `resetValidation()` and a form reset put the fields back on the `validationTiming` schedule.

  An async field check, such as a username lookup, no longer gets lost when the user edits another field before the check finishes.

- A Select with `required` now stops a plain HTML form from submitting when no option is selected. Before, the empty form submitted. Now the browser shows its message next to the Select and puts focus on the Select button. A Select without `required` still lets the Enter key submit the form as before.

  In a Starwind Form, a required Select or Radio Group can be the first field with an error. On submit, or when you call `form.validate({ focus: true })`, focus now goes to the Select button or to a radio, and the page scrolls to it. Before, focus did not go to any control that the user could see. A Radio Group puts focus on its checked radio when one is checked.

  In Astro, a required Checkbox or Radio in a plain HTML form now shows the browser message and gets focus. Before, the form did not submit, and no message showed. In all frameworks, when the browser flags a Checkbox, Radio, or Switch as invalid, focus now goes to the control that the user sees.

  Checkbox and Radio now get their name from a `<label for="...">` that points at their `id`. Before, screen readers read these controls with no name.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- React, Vue, and Svelte Form components now support validation settings, server errors, and options for when errors appear. You can use synchronous or asynchronous validators and configure submission and reset behavior through component props.
- Fixed several component updates and form resets:
  - In Vue, canceling a checkbox, switch, menu, or popup change now keeps its previous value or open state.
  - React and Vue checkboxes and switches keep their original form-reset values after options such as `readOnly` change. Checkbox Group selection now follows the group value, including when a child has its own checked value.
  - React Navigation Menu no longer crashes when the open content is removed. React Sidebar controls now match saved state, and each nested Sidebar opens and closes its own mobile sheet.
  - Vue and Svelte Color Picker keep app-controlled colors and formats under app control, including after form resets. Initialize a controlled value or format when the picker mounts; remount it to change between controlled and uncontrolled use.
  - Input and Dropzone keep working after their input elements or associated forms change. Custom Runtime integrations can call their new `refresh()` methods after these changes.

  Installing the Field Primitive through the CLI now includes its required Input files.

- Fixed component behavior in the following cases:
  - Vue Accordion, Collapsible, Tabs, and menu options keep their previous state when a change is canceled. Alert Dialog, Drawer, and Popover respond to open and close requests from app code.
  - React Checkbox and Switch, and Vue Switch, use the app-provided checked state for their initial native input value. React toggles inside Toggle Group start with the group's selected and disabled state.
  - React and Vue Input OTP restore the original default value after a form reset, including after `readOnly` changes.
  - Avatar connects replacement images and fallbacks. Fieldset keeps its accessible label linked to its current legend.
  - Dialog, Alert Dialog, and Drawer recognize trigger and close buttons added after the component mounts. Custom Runtime integrations can call the new `refresh()` method after adding or replacing these buttons.
  - Vue Toaster now uses the spacing set through its `gap` and `peek` props.

  Tabs keeps its initial `syncKey` for its mounted lifetime. Remount Tabs to change that key.

- Tabs now supports CSS entrance and exit animations. Panels stay visible until their exit animation finishes, while inactive content stops accepting keyboard focus and clicks. Use `data-starting-style` and `data-ending-style` to style the animations.

  When your code changes the selected tab, pressing Tab to enter the tab list now focuses that tab. Focus stays in place while someone is already navigating the list.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed Color Picker form resets in React and Vue. Canceling a reset now keeps the selected color and format, and a pending reset no longer overwrites a newer selection or slider change.

  For custom Runtime integrations, the new `stateSync` subscription lets you update your UI after a form reset finishes without firing a user-change event.

- Fixed Combobox values and input text after form resets. Canceling a reset keeps the current value, and a pending reset no longer overwrites newer input.

  In React, pressing Escape restores the expected input text. In Vue, canceling an input change restores the previous text.

- Fixed Select labels in Vue and Svelte when the selected option's text changes or its option loads after the value is set. The displayed label now updates while the popup is open or closed.
- Fixed CLI installs that omitted files or packages required by a component. Existing component APIs remain unchanged.
- Reduced JavaScript in Vue Checkbox, Checkbox Group, Switch, Radio, Radio Group, Toggle, and Toggle Group. Component props and defaults stay the same.
- Reduced background work on Vue pages with multiple menus, tooltips, or other components that use portals. These components now share the work of watching for changes to the page.
- Fixed nested overlays in Vue and Svelte, including Select menus appearing behind a Color Picker.

  Nested overlays can now render directly under the document body. If your custom CSS selectors or DOM queries depend on an overlay staying inside its parent, set a portal container or add `data-floating-root` to the element that should contain it. Overlays inside Dialog still use its floating container.

- Fixed open Vue tooltips and hover cards losing their position when the component updates. They stay attached to their trigger and respect newer open or close requests from your app.
