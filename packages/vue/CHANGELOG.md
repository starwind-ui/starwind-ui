# @starwind-ui/vue

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Removed the undocumented `open`, `close`, `updatePosition`, `getValue`, and `setValue` methods from the template refs of the Vue Menu, Context Menu, Select, Combobox, and Navigation Menu roots. These refs now expose only `element`.

  If you call one of these methods through a template ref, use `v-model` on the root instead. For example, put `v-model:open="open"` on the root and change `menu.value.open()` to `open.value = true`.

- Vue `Slider.Thumb` now accepts `inputRef`, as it does in React and Svelte. Pass a function to receive the hidden range input.

### Patch Changes

- Combobox now closes when focus leaves it. Before, the list stayed open after you typed and pressed Tab or Shift+Tab. The list stays open while focus moves between the input, the trigger, and the clear button, and it closes when focus moves past them. Pressing the trigger, the clear button, or another part of the input group keeps focus in the input in every browser, including Safari.

  This close uses the new `focus-out` reason. Call `cancel()` in `onOpenChange` to keep the list open. Focus then goes back to the input. Text you typed but did not pick goes back to the previous text, as it does after Escape or a press outside the list.

  When your code controls the Combobox `value` and keeps it without calling `cancel()`, the input text now shows the label of the value you kept. Before, the input kept the label of the item that was pressed. The text change that restores the input uses the `imperative-action` reason.

- Fixed a Combobox that has more than one `ComboboxClear`. Before, only the first one worked. Pressing another one did not clear the selection or the text, and inside the input group it opened the list. Now every `ComboboxClear` clears the selection and the text, and each one shows the disabled state.
- Fixed a Combobox that has a `ComboboxTrigger` you added yourself. Styled `ComboboxInput` already renders its own trigger, and only that first trigger worked. Pressing your trigger a second time did not close the list, and outside the input group your trigger did nothing. Now every trigger opens and closes the list, and each one shows the open and disabled state.
- React `Select` and `Combobox` inside a `Field` with a `name` now send their value when the form submits. Before, the form often left the value out, because React removed the name from the hidden input each time it rendered. React `Input OTP` gets the same fix.

  React `Select` and `Combobox` inside a `Field` now call `onValueChange`, `onOpenChange`, and `onInputValueChange`, and they follow a parent that holds `value`. Before, these callbacks did not run. The parent kept the old value while the control showed the new one, and the form sent the old one.

  Astro `Checkbox` and `Switch` inside a `Field` now clear when the form resets. Before, they stayed checked.

  A `name` on the control now wins over the `name` on its `Field`, in all frameworks. For example, `<Field name="fruit"><Select name="own">` submits `own`. Before, the `Field` name usually won. If you set different names on a `Field` and its control, and your server reads the `Field` name, remove the `name` from the control.

- Fixed a Navigation Menu panel that flashed and closed when you moved the mouse to a trigger and clicked it. Hover opened the panel first, and the click then closed it. Now a click that starts within 500 ms after hover opened the panel keeps it open. A second click, a later click, the keyboard, and touch still close it.
- Combobox now sends its events in the same order in Astro, React, Vue, and Svelte. Pressing an item gives the value change, then the input text change with the `item-press` reason, then the open change. Clearing gives the value change, then the input text change to `""` with the `clear` reason. You can cancel the input text change in every framework.

  When you cancel a typed change, the input text goes back to the previous text. This now also works in Astro.

  When your code controls `inputValue`, typing in the middle of the text now keeps the caret where it is. Before, the caret moved to the end after each key. Text that your code does not accept still goes back to your value.

  React `Combobox` now opens on the first focus of its input, as it does in Astro, Vue, and Svelte.

  Styled `ComboboxClear` with `asChild` now uses your child as the button. Before, the default icon made a button inside a button in Vue and React, and a hydration mismatch in Nuxt. Add your own icon to the child if you want one.

  A form reset now keeps a value that your code controls, and the input text follows that value.

  If you use Runtime directly and your items render only when the list opens, pass the new `resolveValueText` option to `createCombobox`. It returns the label for a selected value whose item is not rendered.

- Fixed triggers on links and spans that stayed disabled when a framework wrote `disabled="false"`. This affected Tooltip, Hover Card, Popover, Menu, Context Menu, Toggle, Toggle Group, and Theme Toggle. On a native form control, any `disabled` attribute still disables it.
- Popover, Navigation Menu, and non-modal Dialog no longer take focus back when you have moved on. Before, if you moved to another control while the popup was closing, focus jumped back to the old trigger when the closing animation ended. This also closed a Combobox that you had just opened. Focus now goes back to the trigger only when it is still inside the popup or no control has focus.

  Popover also keeps focus on a field that you press outside the popup. Before, focus went to the Popover trigger when the closing animation ended.

  Pressing the trigger of an open Select in Safari now closes the list. Before, the list closed and opened again.

- Fixed Input writing an unchanged value back into the field. In some browsers this moved the caret or ended an IME composition.

  Vue Input now keeps the caret during a normal edit, puts the old text back when the parent refuses a change, and follows a `v-model` that starts as `undefined`.

- Fixed a blank Select trigger in Astro and Vue when `Select.Value` has its own content and no `placeholder`. For example, `<Select.Value>Astro</Select.Value>` now shows "Astro" until a value is chosen, and shows it again when the value clears. React already did this. This also works when the Select starts with a value and clears later.

  Fixed React Select showing the placeholder after a parent refused a pick. The trigger now keeps the label of the parent value, as it does in Vue and Svelte.

- Fixed several Vue components so that they match React:
  - A Boolean prop that you leave out of a Styled component no longer becomes `false`. The default of the underlying component applies instead.
  - `v-model` now works on Textarea, Native Select, and Input Group Textarea. It waits until IME composition ends, as native `v-model` does.
  - Textarea and Input Group Textarea keep a `v-model` value after a form reset, and they accept `default-value`. With both `v-model` and `default-value`, a reset puts the default into the field and the model, as in Svelte.
  - `Close` parts and `Select.Trigger` with `asChild` now accept a component as the child.
  - Styled `ComboboxTrigger` and `ComboboxClear` with `asChild` accept a child.
  - Styled `TooltipTrigger` with text now renders a working trigger.
  - Tooltip now opens on a native link or span. Collapsible link triggers no longer get `disabled="false"`.
  - Color Picker with `formats` and no `format` now starts on the first listed format. Before, the format selector was blank.
  - Navigation Menu now moves keyboard focus into its content when you use `v-model`.
  - Styled `SelectTrigger` renders `data-size`, and `FieldSeparator` renders `data-content`.
  - `SidebarMenuButton` with `tooltip` keeps `data-slot="sidebar-menu-button"`.
  - `CarouselNext`, `CarouselPrevious`, and `SidebarRail` keep your `aria-label`.
  - `Combobox.Icon` now has `aria-hidden`.

- Fixed Tooltip and Hover Card in Vue and Svelte staying hidden when their popup is replaced while open, for example when the `key` on the content changes.

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Dropzone now tells you when it does not keep a dropped file. Before, if you dropped a PDF on a Dropzone with `accept="image/*"`, nothing happened and no event fired. Now Dropzone rejects dropped files that do not match `accept`. A Dropzone without `multiple` keeps one file and rejects the other dropped files.
  - To get the rejected files, listen for the `starwind:files-reject` event on the Dropzone. In React and Svelte, use `onFilesReject`. In Vue, use `@files-reject`. The event gives you the rejected `files` and the drop `event`.
  - When Dropzone keeps none of the dropped files, the styled Dropzone shows an error border and the root gets a `data-rejected` attribute. The error clears on the next accepted drop, file picker choice, `setFiles` call, or form reset. When a drop keeps some of the files, the event fires but the error border does not show.

  Screen readers do not announce a rejected drop. To tell screen reader users, show a message in a live region when the reject event fires.

### Patch Changes

- A Combobox with `required` now stops a plain HTML form from submitting when no option is selected. Before, the empty form submitted and no message showed. Now the browser shows its message and puts focus in the Combobox input. The list stays closed so it does not cover the message.

  A Combobox without `required` still lets the Enter key submit the form as before.

- Form now lets a submit button with `formnovalidate` skip validation. For example, a "Save draft" button with `formnovalidate` submits the form while required fields are still empty. Your `onSubmit` handler runs, and `submitter` is that button. If you do not use `onSubmit`, the browser submits the form. When a draft submit starts while a normal submit waits for an async check, only the draft submit runs, so `onSubmit` runs one time. Other submit buttons in the form still validate. A `novalidate` attribute on the form does not turn off Form validation.

  Errors that you show with `validate()` now go away when the user fixes the field. This works for `validate({ names, reveal: true })` and for errors that you show with `errorVisibility="manual"`. These fields now check again on the `revalidationTiming` schedule, the same as after a submit. This helps a multi-step form that checks one step when the user clicks "Next". `resetValidation()` and a form reset put the fields back on the `validationTiming` schedule.

  An async field check, such as a username lookup, no longer gets lost when the user edits another field before the check finishes.

- A Select with `required` now stops a plain HTML form from submitting when no option is selected. Before, the empty form submitted. Now the browser shows its message next to the Select and puts focus on the Select button. A Select without `required` still lets the Enter key submit the form as before.

  In a Starwind Form, a required Select or Radio Group can be the first field with an error. On submit, or when you call `form.validate({ focus: true })`, focus now goes to the Select button or to a radio, and the page scrolls to it. Before, focus did not go to any control that the user could see. A Radio Group puts focus on its checked radio when one is checked.

  In Astro, a required Checkbox or Radio in a plain HTML form now shows the browser message and gets focus. Before, the form did not submit, and no message showed. In all frameworks, when the browser flags a Checkbox, Radio, or Switch as invalid, focus now goes to the control that the user sees.

  Checkbox and Radio now get their name from a `<label for="...">` that points at their `id`. Before, screen readers read these controls with no name.

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- React, Vue, and Svelte Form components now support validation settings, server errors, and options for when errors appear. You can use synchronous or asynchronous validators and configure submission and reset behavior through component props.
- Fixed several component updates and form resets:
  - In Vue, canceling a checkbox, switch, menu, or popup change now keeps its previous value or open state.
  - React and Vue checkboxes and switches keep their original form-reset values after options such as `readOnly` change. Checkbox Group selection now follows the group value, including when a child has its own checked value.
  - React Navigation Menu no longer crashes when the open content is removed. React Sidebar controls now match saved state, and each nested Sidebar opens and closes its own mobile sheet.
  - Vue and Svelte Color Picker keep app-controlled colors and formats under app control, including after form resets. Initialize a controlled value or format when the picker mounts; remount it to change between controlled and uncontrolled use.
  - Input and Dropzone keep working after their input elements or associated forms change. Custom Runtime integrations can call their new `refresh()` methods after these changes.

  Installing the Field Primitive through the CLI now includes its required Input files.

- Fixed component behavior in the following cases:
  - Vue Accordion, Collapsible, Tabs, and menu options keep their previous state when a change is canceled. Alert Dialog, Drawer, and Popover respond to open and close requests from app code.
  - React Checkbox and Switch, and Vue Switch, use the app-provided checked state for their initial native input value. React toggles inside Toggle Group start with the group's selected and disabled state.
  - React and Vue Input OTP restore the original default value after a form reset, including after `readOnly` changes.
  - Avatar connects replacement images and fallbacks. Fieldset keeps its accessible label linked to its current legend.
  - Dialog, Alert Dialog, and Drawer recognize trigger and close buttons added after the component mounts. Custom Runtime integrations can call the new `refresh()` method after adding or replacing these buttons.
  - Vue Toaster now uses the spacing set through its `gap` and `peek` props.

  Tabs keeps its initial `syncKey` for its mounted lifetime. Remount Tabs to change that key.

- Tabs now supports CSS entrance and exit animations. Panels stay visible until their exit animation finishes, while inactive content stops accepting keyboard focus and clicks. Use `data-starting-style` and `data-ending-style` to style the animations.

  When your code changes the selected tab, pressing Tab to enter the tab list now focuses that tab. Focus stays in place while someone is already navigating the list.

### Patch Changes

- Fixed Color Picker form resets in React and Vue. Canceling a reset now keeps the selected color and format, and a pending reset no longer overwrites a newer selection or slider change.

  For custom Runtime integrations, the new `stateSync` subscription lets you update your UI after a form reset finishes without firing a user-change event.

- Fixed Combobox values and input text after form resets. Canceling a reset keeps the current value, and a pending reset no longer overwrites newer input.

  In React, pressing Escape restores the expected input text. In Vue, canceling an input change restores the previous text.

- Fixed Select labels in Vue and Svelte when the selected option's text changes or its option loads after the value is set. The displayed label now updates while the popup is open or closed.
- Fixed CLI installs that omitted files or packages required by a component. Existing component APIs remain unchanged.
- Reduced JavaScript in Vue Checkbox, Checkbox Group, Switch, Radio, Radio Group, Toggle, and Toggle Group. Component props and defaults stay the same.
- Reduced background work on Vue pages with multiple menus, tooltips, or other components that use portals. These components now share the work of watching for changes to the page.
- Fixed nested overlays in Vue and Svelte, including Select menus appearing behind a Color Picker.

  Nested overlays can now render directly under the document body. If your custom CSS selectors or DOM queries depend on an overlay staying inside its parent, set a portal container or add `data-floating-root` to the element that should contain it. Overlays inside Dialog still use its floating container.

- Fixed open Vue tooltips and hover cards losing their position when the component updates. They stay attached to their trigger and respect newer open or close requests from your app.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Select, Combobox, and Menu groups now get their name from their visible heading, so screen readers announce the group. The Tabs indicator now lines up with the selected tab when a parent element is scaled. Astro, React, and Vue get these fixes, and the CLI delivers them to installed components. The Vue package stays on its beta release channel.
- Removed old comments from the Vue component files that said the code was internal and not for release. The CLI also removes the blank line that these comments left in the Vue Primitive `index.ts` files that it copies into your project.
- Updated dependencies
  - @starwind-ui/runtime@1.2.1

## 0.1.0

### Minor Changes

- First beta release of `@starwind-ui/vue` for Vue 3.5.
