Fixed a Combobox that has a `ComboboxTrigger` you added yourself. Styled `ComboboxInput` already renders its own trigger, and only that first trigger worked. Pressing your trigger a second time did not close the list, and outside the input group your trigger did nothing. Now every trigger opens and closes the list, and each one shows the open and disabled state.
