React `Select` and `Combobox` inside a `Field` with a `name` now send their value when the form submits. Before, the form often left the value out, because React removed the name from the hidden input each time it rendered. React `Input OTP` gets the same fix.

React `Select` and `Combobox` inside a `Field` now call `onValueChange`, `onOpenChange`, and `onInputValueChange`, and they follow a parent that holds `value`. Before, these callbacks did not run. The parent kept the old value while the control showed the new one, and the form sent the old one.

Astro `Checkbox` and `Switch` inside a `Field` now clear when the form resets. Before, they stayed checked.

A `name` on the control now wins over the `name` on its `Field`, in all frameworks. For example, `<Field name="fruit"><Select name="own">` submits `own`. Before, the `Field` name usually won. If you set different names on a `Field` and its control, and your server reads the `Field` name, remove the `name` from the control.
