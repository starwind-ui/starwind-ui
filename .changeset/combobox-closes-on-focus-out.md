Combobox now closes when focus leaves it. Before, the list stayed open after you typed and pressed Tab or Shift+Tab. The list stays open while focus moves between the input, the trigger, and the clear button, and it closes when focus moves past them. Pressing the trigger, the clear button, or another part of the input group keeps focus in the input in every browser, including Safari.

This close uses the new `focus-out` reason. Call `cancel()` in `onOpenChange` to keep the list open. Focus then goes back to the input. Text you typed but did not pick goes back to the previous text, as it does after Escape or a press outside the list.

When your code controls the Combobox `value` and keeps it without calling `cancel()`, the input text now shows the label of the value you kept. Before, the input kept the label of the item that was pressed. The text change that restores the input uses the `imperative-action` reason.
