Fixed a Navigation Menu panel that flashed and closed when you moved the mouse to a trigger and clicked it. Hover opened the panel first, and the click then closed it. Now a click that starts within 500 ms after hover opened the panel keeps it open. A second click, a later click, the keyboard, and touch still close it.
