"@starwind-ui/core": patch

Dialog trigger now correctly preserves its default styling while appending user-provided class names when used as a child component. This ensures custom styles work without overriding core styles and maintains consistent appearance across usage patterns. No API changes; improved compatibility with theming and design systems.
